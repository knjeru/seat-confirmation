## Welcome to our seating confirmation app!

- Our current app offers a proof of concept view for how users will be able to view and select available seats when booking a flight through one of our partners.
- Please don't mind our dust as we plan to expand our app to include a legend as well as a more mobile/user-friendly UI/UX in the future!
- We look forward to hearing your feedback!

### To run our application:
- Git clone this repo
- After cloning, in the directory run the following command `ng serve`
- This will build and serve up the application to a port on localhost
- Follow the link indicated by the CLI to view the app!
- Selectable seats are blue and will turn green once selected
- Only one seat can be selected at a time
